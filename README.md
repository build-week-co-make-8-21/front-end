## Co-Make is your local hub to resolve issues in your community.

### With Co-Make, you can make your voice heard on the issues you would like to see resolved in your community.

### As well as seeing real change in your community, you get rewards for being a positive community member in the form of points, freebies and local recognition.

### The problem we are solving: the disintegration in the relationship between local government and the people they represent. The feeling of apathy many have towards local issues.

### The inability of local government to reach and listen to their constituents effectively.
